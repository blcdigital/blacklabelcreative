The Pool creates interesting, inspiring, original content for busy women, produced by a team of established journalists, editors and broadcasters, founded by Sam Baker and Lauren Laverne.

I was asked by [Byng](http://byng.co/){: target="_blank"} to lead the front-end team. The brief was to engineer a site that was fully responsive and with performance in mind. As such we chose to use NEAT to scaffold the site which allowed us to rapidly prototype layouts and move forward with the ones that gave the best results. Coupled with LESS and a simple module pattern based approach to the Javascript we were able to create a very flexible solution.
