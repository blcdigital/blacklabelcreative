The brief was to deliver templates the in-house team could integrate into their ecommerce platform. However, due to the complex nature of the site we needed to create an almost full back end service to show off the features we had created. This included:

- AJAX basket population
- Continuous loading of products when you reached the end of a page
- Shopping list style product search
- Templates and functionality for the checkout and delivery booking process

This project also used a wide variety of tools and templating engines (Fabric, GruntJS, Mustache and BackboneJS to name a few) to help build a site of such scale.
