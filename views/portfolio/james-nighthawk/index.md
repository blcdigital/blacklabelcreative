This is a site for an up-and-coming folk artist to showcase their work, writing and to advertise future gigs.

We needed to make it easy to use for both the user and for James to update. We selected Wordpress as this has the neatest administration interface and also gives flexibility to build on top of the exiting features.

For this project I worked closely the designer, <a href="http://www.karlkisala.co.uk" target="_blank">Karl Kisala</a>, so we could also deliver a responsive build and by adding a range of customisations to Wordpress we have created a site that fits the client's requirements perfectly.
