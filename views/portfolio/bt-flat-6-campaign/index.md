Working on the online portion of the campaign to introduce the BT Flatmates, I acted as the team lead. With a large amount of work to do and tight deadlines I was responsible for ensuring the work was completed to a high standard and in a timely manner, while also keeping the day-to-day work going.

I worked very closely with the design team as the micro-site was continually evolving as the build was being carried out. Prototypes needed to be made for chapters 1 and 2 so the client could understand the direction we wanted to go in.

Although stressful at times, this is one of the most rewarding pieces of work I have done in my career to date.
