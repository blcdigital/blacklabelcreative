The brief was to not only to showcase the depth and breadth of the product range, but also help increase the perceptions of that offering with existing customers, and to the wider homeware market.

Using Wordpress as the CMS gave us the flexibility to build a relatively complex site quickly and allowed the client to manage the content and products themselves. A Store Locator API, built using MongoDB and NodeJS, was also created which has allowed the client to re-use the same service on other offerings such as the 2014 <a href="https://www.sainsburyslocalcharity.co.uk/" target="_blank">Local Charities site</a>.

The site first launched the Autumn/Winter collection in September 2013, and the product ranges are updated to reflect the seasonal calendar.
