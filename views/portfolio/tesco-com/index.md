Having spent 18 months working at Tesco, I have been involved in everything from weekly updates to micro-site creation and development. Highlights include being involved in bring the marketing email creation in-house, redeveloping the Entertainment area and developing new functionality for the Christmas 2007 and Direct Catalogue Launch (March 2008) micro-sites.
