I was asked by [The BIO Agency](http://thebioagency.com/){: target="_blank"} to lead the project team for this template build. The solution had to integrate with a bespoke CMS which meant that any additional mark-up produced by the CMS had to be added to the templates to ensure a smooth handover.

This was a re-branding exercise to position the company to allow access to a new market. The project was a multilingual, fully responsive site with strong art direction with a lot of animation. This was particularly challenging due to the wide range of devices that needed to be supported and the low level of support for CSS and Javascript sometimes available.
