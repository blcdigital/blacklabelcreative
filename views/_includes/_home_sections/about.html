            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>I've been working with the web since 2006 and have a strong knowledge of <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> (extended with <b>SASS/LESS</b>) and <b>Javascript</b> (including <b>Backbone.js</b>, <b>ReactJS</b> and the almost standard <b>jQuery</b>, to name a few). I've also spent some time building sites with <b>Wordpress</b> as the CMS and <b>NodeJS</b> driven applications and APIs.</p>

            <p>Over the years I've worked for a range of companies and agencies on everything from small marketing sites to platform rebuilds and responsive email templates.</p>

            <p>My love for technology doesn't stop when the clock hits 6pm. Around usual working hours I've made paper circuits things with conductive ink, models for 3D printing, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/qek1HbP2Xi/" target="_blank">holograms</a>, motion tracking prototypes with Kinect and Leap Motion, and some templates and tools to make my (and maybe some others) development lives a little easier. Anything that works (and sometimes doesn't) will usually appear on <a href="http://github.com/donofkarma" target="_blank">my Github account</a>.</p>

            <h3>Availability</h3>
            <p><b>I'm currently available for work</b> so if you've got any projects you'd like to talk to me about, <a href="mailto:jasal@blacklabelcreative.com">drop me an email</a>.</p>
