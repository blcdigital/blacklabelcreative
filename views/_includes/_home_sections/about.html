            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>I've been working with the web since 2006 and have a strong knowledge of <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> (extended with <b>SASS/LESS</b>) and <b>Javascript</b> (including <b>Backbone.js</b> or <b>ReactJS</b>). I've also spent a lot of time building sites with <b>Wordpress</b> as the CMS and <b>NodeJS</b> driven applications and APIs.</p>

            <p>Over the years I've worked for a range of companies and agencies on everything from small marketing sites to platform rebuilds and responsive email templates.</p>

            <p>My love for technology doesn't stop when the clock hits 6pm. Around usual working hours I've made paper circuits things with conductive ink, models for 3D printing, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/qek1HbP2Xi/" target="_blank">holograms</a>, motion tracking prototypes with Kinect and Leap Motion, and some templates and tools to make my (and maybe some others) development lives a little easier. Anything that works (and sometimes doesn't) will usually appear on <a href="http://github.com/donofkarma" target="_blank">my Github account</a>.</p>

            <h3>Availability</h3>
            <p>I'm currently <b>unavailable for work</b> until <b>September 2017</b>. I'm still happy to discuss any projects you may have coming up so feel free to <a href="mailto:jasal@blacklabelcreative.com">drop me an email</a>.</p>
