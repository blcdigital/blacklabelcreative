title: "Responsive Day Out roundup"
---

At the beginning of March I was one of about 400 people that attended Responsive Day Out. The day long conference was all about – you guessed it – responsive design, development and process. It featured a range of speakers with varying degrees of experience and insight into the topic. Overall it gave a good perspective of where we are as an industry, namely not very far! Everything is still very new and things (images, load time, etc) need to  be worked out.

## The talks

The day was split out into blocks of three talks followed by a Q&A with the speakers. It was a nice informal atmosphere which fitted well with the type of day it was – more on that later.

My favourite talks are listed below:

**Tom Malen: Cutting the Mustard** - Tom's from the BBC and he talks bout their approach when it comes to the development process. They have an interesting way of dealing with the JS features on the site.

**Anna Debenham: Playing with Games Console Browsers** - Going by some of the stats in the talk, game console browsers could be something that we may need to seriously cater for.

**Andy Hume: The Anatomy of a Responsive Page Load** - Fairly self explanatory but some good advice how how to deal with lots of assets in a responsive context.

Finally, **Owen Gregory: Antiphonal Geometry** looks at the relationship between device screen aspect ratios and musical intervals. Seems like coincidence to me but interesting nonetheless.

To listen to these talks, [head to Jeremy's site](http://adactio.com/journal/6091/). He's got all the audio from the day including the Q&As between each talk.

## The day

I've mentioned the format of the day already but that wasn't all that set this conference apart. It was noted out from the beginning that this would be a no frills event and that was definitely followed through with the sponsor paid for coffee cart, after party and the lack of wi-fi. Although not the norm, this actually turned out to be a good thing as the lack of a constant internet connection we were free to absorb the content instead of constantly having our attention taken by the likes of twitter and any work emails landing in our inboxes.

The main intention of this austerity was to keep the door price as low as possible and at £50 (plus VAT) this was successfully achieved. A lot has been written about conference organisation and costs before but I hope this is the start of a new trend where conferences are of a high quality and aren't prohibitively expensive.
