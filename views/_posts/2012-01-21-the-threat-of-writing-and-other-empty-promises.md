2011 was the year I wanted to start writing. To get some of the ideas floating around in my head down on paper. Not just things I wanted to say, but for random bits of code that might work, that I could share, learn from and that maybe could help someone else.

That didn't happen. In fact in the 11 months the latest version of the site has been live, I have written 3 things. Not looking good so far.

So what went wrong? Honestly, I'm not really sure. I've done lots of things and had lots of thoughts that I would have written about but never actually gotten round to it. I don't want to spend too long speculating about the reasons as anything I can think of seems like an excuse, and in the spirit of the New Year I think it's only right to look forward at ways I can help myself write more.

My first step was making it easier for me to write. Seeing as I don't have my laptop on me all the time I thought it would be a good idea to grab the WordPress app. I've come to realise I use my phone for everything - from waking me up in the morning to helping keep track of how many miles I get between trips to the petrol station - so why not use it for this too? That way I can start scribbling down the basis for an article wherever I am. In fact, I started this article on the way home!

The second was writing this, the line in the sand, the statement of intent for the coming months. I've been told I should write about some of the work I've been doing and have been inspired by the new blogging adventures of a very good friend of mine ([RP Without G - Musings of an Xbox widow](http://rpwithoutg.blogspot.co.uk/)). I think the time has come for me to at least make a start.

The final for the time being was deciding that I need to amend the website. I'm not going for a full redesign but I think there are some improvements to be made to the under pinning code. I've learnt a lot over the past few months and I think it would be a shame not to try and incorporate some of that. Knowing me, it will mean starting from scratch but it should be worth it.

So there we have it. I'm not sure how well this will work but I'm going to give it a go regardless. Stay tuned for the website update plan.
