With a global, potentially high traffic site, performance was key. The concurrency offered by NodeJS allowed us to create a site that can seamlessly handle a large volume of users without adversely effecting performance for a relatively low budget. Using a database-less approach we found alternative ways to handle the content for each of the 10 (and growing) locales which allowed simple updates and maintains the integrity of the data.

The front end of the site is responsively built and leverages the site's own API to retrieve gift results based on the user's selections.
