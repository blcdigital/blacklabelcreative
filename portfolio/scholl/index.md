We were asked by Scholl to recreate their online store to allow more marketing around the site, a blog to showcase development within the brand and highlight special offers around the site.

I was involved towards the end of this project with bug fixing and also in developing some simple enhancements such as a simple image switcher to show alternate product images on product pages, image zoomer and range based product refinement.
