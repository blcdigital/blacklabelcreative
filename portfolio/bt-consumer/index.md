As part of the retained team I was able to work on a wide variety of improvements to the BT Consumer website as well as some new features. Development was carried out in flat HTML which was then integrated into their content management system by the BT team with the assistance of someone from LBi.

Improvements and new features include:

- New TV package page
- OnLive gaming features page
- Global toolbar integrating a broadband speed checker, free view checker and prototype package selection tool
- New Whatâ€™s on cover flow style carousel with more customisation options
