title: "Making Holograms"

I'm not entirely sure how this whole scenario came about, most likely from a random conversation with [http://twitter.com/andydotdobson](Andy), but one warm summer afternoon (yes, I'm only writing about it now) I set aside some project work and started cutting up little bits of plastic. Much to the confusion of anyone walking passed my desk.

The goal was to create a small scale version of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper's_ghost](Pepper's Ghost) effect using a mobile phone screen as the projector.

The maths was straight forward enough - make a truncated square pyramid with the faces sitting at approximately a 45degree angle. This should be sufficient enough to take the image on the phone and make it appear as if it were floating in front of you.
