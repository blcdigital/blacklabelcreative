So, it's been a shade over 6 months since my last post. So far, this whole blogging thing isn't going too well.

I set out in [January]({% post_url 2012-01-21-the-threat-of-writing-and-other-empty-promises %}) to keep a constant log of the things I was working on, learning and interesting parts of my life and I've only updated a handful of times. Looks like doing all of the above doesn't leave much time for writing about them!

One thing that I have managed to achieve (as contradictory as it may sound) is to not spend too much of my free time at my laptop. It got to the point where it wasn't healthy and it needed to stop.

## Site update

I've decided to throw caution to the wind – largely through lack of time – and start developing the new version. The designs I've made so far will now be my wireframes and I'm going to go ahead and build straight from them. I'll still be doing it live so there'll may well be a few broken things in different browsers, but it might spur me on to keep pace with the project.

## Projects

Project work has been business as usual, with work taking up just about all of my time. The hero player has had a few updates (touch interaction coming soon) and a couple of new ones have been added.

## Notd

This is a small note taking and todo app which is helping me learn [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), [lodash](http://lodash.com/) and [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/). It's still in it's early stages – so far the todo and local storage parts are working well. As always [this is open sourced through github](https://github.com/donofkarma/notd) so feel free to take a look.

An off-shoot of this app is a template ([backbone-require-template](https://github.com/donofkarma/backbone-require-template)) which I'll be using for any suitable projects in the future.

More on both of these soon.

Thats it for now. More updates to (hopefully) follow.
