Just before embarking on a stag weekend to Bath, I pushed the new design live. I know some people will say that this wasn't a great idea but it did succeed in stopping me pixel pushing… constantly… I've always been bad at getting my personal projects live as I can never seem to find a point at which I am happy with the state of the work. It's easy when you have an actual client as there are clear expectations and deliverables you can use to define when you are "finished". With personal work/projects I find that being the client, EA, designer and developer is horrible as any small amend or idea I have can be tried instantly. Maybe I should try project managing too?

So with a long weekend buffering any small amends I thought about, but only an iPhone to hand to do anything with, I was stuck. It did give me time to think about those changes and largely decide they where pointless – which is great, but also points to me being a bit impulsive (not always a bad thing!).

As promised the site is still in development – I'm currently working on getting all of the content together for the Portfolio section which I'm looking to have (mostly) live in the next few days.

Also as promised testing is a little thin on the ground, as so far the only devices to have seen it are an iPhone 4 and a couple of iPads (2nd and 3rd generations). Browser wise I've hit what I've got on my MBP and my housemate's Windows 7 laptop – Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE9. More testing will occur when I have the Portfolio section sorted out. Having said that, anyone willing to donate an Android handset running any of the newer versions of the OS and a few minutes of their time please drop me an email/comment!

Finally, for those wondering about the stag weekend: yes, it was epic and yes, Bath is an amazing city! Next time I plan to see more of it in a less drunken haze.
