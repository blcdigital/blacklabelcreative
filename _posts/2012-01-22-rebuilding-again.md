So far every incarnation of this site has been put together fairly quickly, for a number of reasons, but primarily to get my work online. As a result I've not had time to think about what I actually want in addition to a portfolio, other than an about page. The blog was essentially a bolt on – it's what WordPress was actually made for, so I never removed it.

For this rebuild I've actually got a vague plan of action:

- Make a site map
- Decide what extras are on each page (sidebar content, etc.)
- Basic design – mobile first
- Build it!

I've left out any kind of wire framing as that'll get constantly changed as I design. Also, starting mobile first will help me refine the content to what I actually need on the page.

The way I build it will also be a new thing for me, as I'll be doing it live (sort of). Every time I finish a section, no matter how small, I'll add it immediately to the live site. This is so I can keep the development ticking over nicely and stay focused. Yes, there will no doubt be a couple of bugs that appear, although I'll do my best to limit this.

With plan layed out, the only thing left is to start the process. No time like the present I guess!
