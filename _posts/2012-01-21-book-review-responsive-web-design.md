[Responsive Web Design](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) serves as a practical guide to creating a flexible layout suitable for a range of screen sizes and is written by Ethan Marcotte – the man who actually coined the term "responsive web design".

In the introductory chapter, Ethan states:

> ...Ultimately, I know so little about you. I don't know how you're reading this. I can't.

Given the number of ways we can now consume online media, this statement is very important as we can no longer continue to assume the user will be on a desktop. Also this, in effect, extends the old multiple browser scenario to include multiple devices as well.

The book's method of creating a flexible layout has three major sections:

- The Flexible Grid
- Flexible images and media
- Media queries

The method also starts with the full desktop site (assumed to be handed over from a designer as a PSD) and makes it scale to work on smaller screens with the use of percentage values for widths, margin and padding. Yes, there is some maths involved but it's one simple equation to get the "flexible” values from the desktop design. Although this works for the case study used in the book ([Robot or Not](http://robot-or-not.com/)), I prefer the mobile first approach discussed at the end of the book as I think it will suit more complex sites.

As you would expect each section has it's own chapter, but it isn't just the theory and a best case implementation on the latest browser/device. Ethan actually takes the time to show you how to get things working in older browsers as well - namely in IE where things aren't always straight forward.

Overall Responsive Web Design is well written, informative, occasionally funny and provides techniques you can actually use today. Well worth a read as it provides a good base for creating mobile friendly sites.
