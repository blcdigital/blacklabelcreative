Everything feels like it has been a little quiet over the last month. I've been cracking on when I can, getting the basic layouts done for the mobile and tablet versions of the site. I've also been getting distracted, which is a fairly easy thing to do when it's a non-work related project.

The two main items of distraction have been sorting a trip up to Leeds for my friend Matt's birthday and my car (lots more on that later).

Also in the distraction pile is “the hero player of a thousand versions”. Over the last few years I've gone from using third party plugins to writing a new one each time and finally breaking and making my own plugin for what feels like the same thing, bar a few tweaks for each implementation. No matter what you've called it (hero player/featured content viewer/carousel/whatever), you'll most probably have used one yourself. If not, well played!

A couple of weeks ago I broke again and have picked up the code, dusted it off and started ripping it apart. I've even added it to GutHub and you can read about it here: [The hero player of a thousand versions]({% post_url 2012-02-29-the-hero-player-of-a-thousand-versions %}). Essentially I'm trying to make it better, more efficient and extensible, eventually releasing it as an actual plugin.

Finally, the car. I'm amazed I've got this far without mentioning it. It's a Megane and it's awesome but servicing and some major part replacement have hit at once so am running around getting quotes and working out who to send it to. All fun and games but definitely worth it in the end!

On paper it's not what you'd call a busy month but it goes the show the little bits do add up to something significant. Expect more car related shenanigans soon but I'll try and keep them to a minimum.
