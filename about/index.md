# Hello, I’m Jasal

I am a User Interface Developer currently living in London, England.

I have been working with the web since 2006 after gaining a bachelors degree in Computer Science (Honours) from [The University of Hertfordshire](http://www.herts.ac.uk/).

By day I am employed full-time at [FullSix London](http://www.fullsixuk.com/) in the West End of London. By night I can be found playing (XboxLive) under the alias of "[donofkarma](https://live.xbox.com/en-GB/Profile?GamerTag=donofkarma)" and writing and experimenting here at black label creative.

## About this site

black label creative is my portfolio, code playground and along with twitter, my outlet on the web. Any cool stuff I find will no doubt end up here. I’ll also be adding things about my other passions in life: astrophysics, technology and cars.

The site has been built with HTML, progressively enhanced CSS and some extra interactions courtesy of Javascript. The content is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), compiled by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and if you are really interested it's all available on [Github](https://github.com/donofkarma/blacklabelcreative). The logo has been designed by Karl Kisala and the social icons are Webicons by [Fairhead Creative](http://fairheadcreative.com). **Disclaimer:** All opinions expressed here are my own and not of my employer.
