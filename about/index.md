# Hello, I’m Jasal

I am a User Interface Developer currently living in London, England.

I have been working with the web since 2006 after gaining a bachelors degree in Computer Science (Honours) from [The University of Hertfordshire](http://www.herts.ac.uk/).

By day I am employed full-time at [The Grand Union](http://thegrandunion.com/) in the West End of London. By night I can be found playing (xboxlive and PSN) under the alias of “donofkarma” and now writing and experimenting here at black label creative.

## About this site

black label creative is my portfolio, code playground and along with twitter, my geeky outlet on the web. Any cool stuff I find will no doubt end up here. I’ll also be adding things about my other passions in life: astrophysics, technology and cars.

The site has been built with HTML5, progressively enhanced CSS3 and some extra interactions courtesy of jQuery all on top of a WordPress base. The logo has been designed by Karl Kisala and the social icons are Simple & Elegant available from Elegant Themes.
